# Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training (CLIP) on Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO)  
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model built on a simplified version of the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset.
The dataset is not shared in this folder.

We test the zero-shot and few-shot learning of the model on the [Chest X-Ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/).

The file `report.pdf` contains information about the results obtained with this model, its limitations and further developments.

This implementation of the algorithm is part of the Ph.D. course "[058623 - ADVANCED TOPICS IN DEEP LEARNING: THE RISE OF TRANSFORMERS](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=795871&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=f32513c9de31c85bba06a8b3d23c5c33)" by Politecnico di Milano university.
